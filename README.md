## Hi ðŸ‘‹ my name is Andrew

I am a backend developer with over 2 years of experience working with Java and 1 year of managing a small team. Throughout my career, I have worked in product teams, and I truly enjoy it: being involved in projects from designing technical solutions to supporting them in production.
