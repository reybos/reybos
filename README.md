## Hi 👋 my name is Andrew

**“Who would have thought?”** — a question I find myself asking more and more as I reflect on my career and personal life. Each time, I’m glad that the answers are positive. Who would have thought that I would change careers and become a backend developer at one of the leading IT companies in Russia? Who would have thought that I would move to Europe? Who would have thought that I would visit so many countries in just one year? Who would have thought that…?

I am a backend developer with over 2 years of experience working with Java and 1 year of managing a small team. Throughout my career, I have worked in product teams, and I truly enjoy it: being involved in projects from designing technical solutions to supporting them in production.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about waste sorting and recycling, run a small blog on Telegram about life in emigration, and enjoy walking and road trips.
